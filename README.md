# webscrapping-disney-wikipedia
My Webscrapping project

Here, I scrape Wikipedia pages to create a dataset on Disney movies. 
These are the things I've done here:
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Cleaning data
- Testing code with Pytest
- Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
- Working with dates (datetime library)
- Saving & loading data with Pickle library
- Accessing data from an API using Requests library
